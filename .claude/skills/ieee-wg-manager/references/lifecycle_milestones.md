## Milestone 8: Maintenance

### Objective
Keep standard current and relevant.

### Maintenance Cycle

**Every 5 Years:**
IEEE requires review of all standards for currency.

**Three Options:**

**1. Reaffirm**
- Standard is still current
- No technical changes needed
- Extend for another 5 years
- Fastest option (few months)

**2. Revise**
- Standard needs updates
- Technical changes required
- Follow full development process again
- Can be amendment or full revision

**3. Withdraw**
- Standard no longer needed
- Technology obsolete
- Superseded by other standard
- Removes from active portfolio

### Administrative Maintenance

**Ongoing Activities:**
- Monitor technology changes
- Track implementation feedback
- Maintain errata list
- Respond to inquiries
- Consider amendments

**Amendment Process:**
- For small, focused changes
- Faster than full revision
- Separate ballot process
- Eventually consolidated into revision

### Timeline
**Reaffirmation**: 3-6 months
**Amendment**: 6-12 months
**Revision**: 18-36 months (full cycle)

### Deliverables (for Revision)
- ✅ Revised standard
- ✅ Change summary
- ✅ Updated references
- ✅ New publication

### Success Criteria
- Standard remains active
- Technical content current
- Community continues use

| 7. Publication | 1-2 months | 26-48 months |

**Total: 2-4 years** (typical)

**NOTE:** Many standards take longer due to:
- Technical complexity
- Ballot recirculations
- Resource constraints
- Stakeholder coordination

---

## Critical Path Items

### Must Not Delay

**PAR Expiration**
- PAR valid for 4 years
- Extension possible but requires justification
- Multiple extensions look bad
- If PAR expires, must restart

**RevCom Submission Deadlines**
- Miss deadline = 3 month delay (next meeting)
- Plan backward from target RevCom meeting

**Ballot Windows**
- 60-90 day periods are fixed
- Cannot rush ballot period
- Plan around holidays/conferences

### Typical Delays

**Working Draft Phase**
- Most variable timeline
- Often underestimated
- Technical complexity emerges
- Mitigation: Regular milestones, accountability

**Comment Resolution**
- Can extend if many comments
- Technical disagreements take time
- Mitigation: Proactive comment management

**Recirculation Ballots**
- Each adds 2-3 months
- Mitigation: Thorough pre-ballot review

## IEEE SA Patent Policy

### Key Principles

**Purpose:**
Ensure that standards can be implemented by the industry while respecting intellectual property rights.

**Policy Statement:**
IEEE SA seeks to ensure that standards can be implemented on Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (RAND) terms.

### Letter of Assurance (LOA)

**What is it?**
A formal statement regarding patent claims that may be essential to implementing a standard.

**Who submits?**
- Standards participants
- Any patent holder with potentially essential patents

**When to submit?**
- During standards development
- Before publication
- After publication (if relevant patents discovered)

**Types of LOA:**

**Positive Statement:**
"I am willing to license on RAND terms"

**Negative Statement:**
"I have no essential patents" OR "I will not enforce my patents"

**Blank LOA:**
No statement (creates uncertainty)

### Participant Responsibility

**All participants MUST:**
- Be aware of the patent policy
- Disclose known essential patents
- Encourage their organizations to submit LOAs

**Participants are NOT required to:**
- Conduct patent searches
- Guarantee no patents exist
- Provide legal advice

### Call for Patents

**Required at:**
- Each working group meeting (chair reminds participants)
- Ballot materials
- Draft publications

**Standard Text:**
"Attention is called to the possibility that implementation of this standard may require use of subject matter covered by patent rights..."

## Conflict of Interest Policy

### What is a Conflict of Interest?

**Definition:**
A situation where personal interests could improperly influence professional judgment.

- Abstentions excluded from calculation
- Invalid ballots not counted

### Disapprove Comment Requirements

**For Sponsor Ballot:**
ALL Disapprove votes MUST include:
- Specific location (section, page, line)

# IEEE Ballot Process Reference

Complete guide to IEEE ballot procedures for working groups.

## Ballot Types

### 1. Working Group Ballot
**Purpose:** Initial technical review by working group members

**Requirements:**
- Majority approval (>50%)
- All WG members eligible to vote
- Typically 30-60 day ballot period
- Comments encouraged but not required for Approve votes

**When to Use:**
- First review of complete draft
- Major revisions to draft
- Before advancing to sponsor ballot

### 2. Sponsor Ballot
**Purpose:** Formal review by sponsor-approved ballot pool

**Requirements:**
- 75% approval (excluding abstentions)
- Ballot pool must be approved by sponsor
- Minimum 60 day ballot period (typically 60-90 days)
- All Disapprove votes MUST include technical comments

**Ballot Pool Formation:**
- IEEE SA Staff coordinates pool formation
- Must include balance of interests
- Minimum pool size varies by sponsor
- Pool must be approved before ballot starts

**When to Use:**
- After successful WG ballot
- Draft is stable and ready for broad review
- Required for IEEE SA Board approval

### 3. Recirculation Ballot
**Purpose:** Review changes made after previous ballot

**Requirements:**
- Same approval threshold as original ballot (75% for sponsor)
- Only changes since previous ballot are balloted
- Shorter ballot period possible (minimum 30 days)
- Must address all previous Disapprove comments

**When to Use:**
- After resolving comments from previous ballot
- If changes are substantive (not just editorial)
- Required if >25% of standard changes after ballot

## Approval Calculations

### Standard Calculation
```
Approval % = (Approve votes) / (Approve + Disapprove votes) × 100%
```

**Key Points:**
- Abstentions are NOT included in calculation
- Only Approve and Disapprove count
- Disapprove without comments may not count (sponsor discretion)

### Return Rate Calculation
```
Return Rate % = (Total Returns) / (Total Invitations) × 100%
```

**Key Points:**
- Return rate includes all responses (Approve, Disapprove, Abstain)
- Low return rate (<50%) may require ballot extension
- Sponsors may have minimum return rate requirements

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:**
- Total Invitations: 50
- Approve: 30
- Disapprove: 5
- Abstain: 10
- No Response: 5

**Results:**
- Returns: 45 (90% return rate)
- Approval: 30/(30+5) = 85.7% → **PASSED**
- Sponsor threshold (75%): **MET**

## Ballot Timeline

### Typical Sponsor Ballot Schedule

**Week 0: Preparation**
- Finalize draft for ballot

- Submit materials to sponsor

**Week 1-2: Pool Formation**
- IEEE SA Staff forms ballot pool
- Pool review and approval
- Invitations sent to pool members

**Week 3: Ballot Opens**
- Ballot materials distributed
- Ballot period begins (Day 1)

**Week 7: Mid-Point**
- Send reminder to non-responders
- Answer questions about draft

**Week 11: Final Reminder**
- Send final reminder (1 week before close)
- Clarify any ballot process questions

**Week 13: Ballot Closes**
- Ballot period ends
- Compile responses
- Categorize comments

**Week 14-15: Initial Review**
- Review all Disapprove comments
- Identify comment categories
- Assign comments to editors/experts

**Week 16+: Comment Resolution**
- Technical review of each comment
- Draft resolutions
- Make necessary changes to draft
- Document disposition of each comment

**Week 20+: Recirculation Decision**
- Determine if changes require recirculation
- If yes: Prepare recirculation ballot
- If no: Submit to RevCom

## Disapprove Comment Requirements

### Valid Disapprove Comments Must Include:

1. **Specific Location**
   - Section/Clause number
   - Page number
   - Line numbers (if applicable)
   - Example: "Section 4.2.1, Page 15, Lines 23-25"

2. **Clear Issue Description**
   - What is the problem?
   - Why is it a problem?
   - Technical basis for objection

3. **Proposed Resolution**
   - Specific suggested change
   - Alternative language
   - Clear fix to the issue

4. **Technical Basis**
   - Not personal preference
   - Related to technical correctness
   - Based on standard's scope

### Invalid Disapprove Comments:

- ✗ "I don't like this section"
- ✗ "The whole draft needs work"
- ✗ "Personal preference for different approach"
- ✗ Comments without specific location
- ✗ Comments without proposed resolution
- ✗ Non-technical objections

### Comment Disposition Options:

**Accepted:**
- Comment is valid and change is made as suggested
- Implementation: Apply exact change proposed by commenter

**Rejected:**
- Comment is not accepted
- Must provide technical rationale for rejection
- Rationale must address commenter's technical concerns

**Accepted in Principle:**
- Comment identified a valid issue
- Resolution differs from commenter's proposal
- Must explain what change was made and why different

## Recirculation Decision Criteria

### Recirculation Required If:

- Changes affect >25% of standard
- New technical requirements added
- Existing requirements significantly modified
- Architecture or approach changes
- Scope modifications

### Recirculation NOT Required If:

- Only editorial changes
- Clarifications that don't change meaning
- Changes affect <25% of standard
- Minor technical corrections
- Format/style improvements

### IEEE SA Guidance:

When in doubt, consult with IEEE SA Staff. Better to recirculate than risk RevCom rejection.

## Best Practices

### Before Starting Ballot:

1. **Working Group Review**
   - Conduct WG ballot first
   - Resolve all WG ballot comments
   - Ensure draft is stable

2. **Quality Check**
   - Complete editorial review
   - Consistent terminology
   - All cross-references correct
   - Figures and tables complete

3. **Ballot Materials**
   - Clear ballot statement
   - Complete draft with version number
   - Ballot instructions
   - Return method documented

### During Ballot:

1. **Communication**
   - Respond promptly to questions
   - Clarify process (not technical content)
   - Send mid-period reminder
   - Final reminder 1 week before close

2. **Track Responses**
   - Monitor return rate
   - Track vote distribution
   - Identify late responders
   - Follow up if return rate low

3. **Document Everything**
   - Save all communications
   - Archive questions and answers
   - Record any process issues

### After Ballot:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Compile all responses
   - Generate results summary
   - Collect all comments
   - Categorize comments

2. **Comment Resolution**
   - Review each comment individually
   - Group similar comments
   - Assign to appropriate experts
   - Draft dispositions

3. **Documentation**
   - Comment disposition spreadsheet
   - Resolution rationale for each
   - Track changes to draft
   - Version control

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Low Return Rate

**Problem:** <50% return rate

**Solutions:**
- Extend ballot period
- Personal outreach to non-responders
- Verify contact information
- Check if ballot materials accessible

### High Disapprove Rate

**Problem:** <75% approval

**Solutions:**
- Analyze comments for patterns
- Identify systematic issues
- Consider major revision
- Additional working group review

### Disapprove Without Comments

**Problem:** Disapprove votes lacking required comments

**Solutions:**
- Contact voter to request comments
- IEEE SA may not count vote without comments
- Follow up before ballot closes

### Late Responses

**Problem:** Ballots arriving after deadline

**Solutions:**
- Policy: Late ballots typically not counted
- Exception: If late ballot wouldn't change outcome
- Document decision either way
- Consult with sponsor/IEEE SA
